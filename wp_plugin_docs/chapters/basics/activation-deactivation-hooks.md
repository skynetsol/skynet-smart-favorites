Activation and deactivation hooks provide ways to perform actions when plugins are activated or deactivated. 

- On activation , plugins can run a routine to add rewrite rules, add custom database tables, or set default option values. 

- On deactivation , plugins can run a routine to remove temporary data such as cache and temp files and directories. 
The deactivation hook is sometimes confused with the uninstall hook . The uninstall hook is best suited to delete all data permanently such as deleting plugin options and custom tables, etc. 
## Activation 

To set up an activation hook, use the register_activation_hook() function: 

```php
register_activation_hook(
	__FILE__,
	'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```

## Deactivation 

To set up a deactivation hook, use the register_deactivation_hook() function: 

```php
register_deactivation_hook(
	__FILE__,
	'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```

The first parameter in each of these functions refers to your main plugin file, which is the file in which you have placed the plugin header comment . Usually these two functions will be triggered from within the main plugin file; however, if the functions are placed in any other file, you must update the first parameter to correctly point to the main plugin file. 

## Example 

One of the most common uses for an activation hook is to refresh WordPress permalinks when a plugin registers a custom post type. This gets rid of the nasty 404 errors. 

Let’s look at an example of how to do this: 

```php
/**
 * Register the "book" custom post type
 */
function pluginprefix_setup_post_type() {
	register_post_type( 'book', ['public' => true ] ); 
} 
add_action( 'init', 'pluginprefix_setup_post_type' );


/**
 * Activate the plugin.
 */
function pluginprefix_activate() { 
	// Trigger our function that registers the custom post type plugin.
	pluginprefix_setup_post_type(); 
	// Clear the permalinks after the post type has been registered.
	flush_rewrite_rules(); 
}
register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'pluginprefix_activate' );
```

If you are unfamiliar with registering custom post types, don’t worry – this will be covered later. This example is used simply because it’s very common. 

Using the example from above, the following is how to reverse this process and deactivate a plugin: 

```php
/**
 * Deactivation hook.
 */
function pluginprefix_deactivate() {
	// Unregister the post type, so the rules are no longer in memory.
	unregister_post_type( 'book' );
	// Clear the permalinks to remove our post type's rules from the database.
	flush_rewrite_rules();
}
register_deactivation_hook( __FILE__, 'pluginprefix_deactivate' );
```
