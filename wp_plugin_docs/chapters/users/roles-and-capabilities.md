Roles and capabilities are two important aspects of WordPress that allow you to control user privileges. 

WordPress stores the Roles and their Capabilities in the `options `table under the `user_roles `key. 

## Roles 

A role defines a set of capabilities for a user. For example, what the user may see and do in his dashboard. 

By default, WordPress have six roles: 

- Super Admin 

- Administrator 

- Editor 

- Author 

- Contributor 

- Subscriber 

More roles can be added and the default roles can be removed. 

### Adding Roles 

Add new roles and assign capabilities to them with add_role() . 

```php
function wporg_simple_role() {
	add_role(
		'simple_role',
		'Simple Role',
		array(
			'read'         => true,
			'edit_posts'   => true,
			'upload_files' => true,
		),
	);
}

// Add the simple_role.
add_action( 'init', 'wporg_simple_role' );
```
After the first call to add_role() , the Role and it’s Capabilities will be stored in the database! 

Sequential calls will do nothing: including altering the capabilities list, which might not be the behavior that you’re expecting. To alter the capabilities list in bulk: remove the role using remove_role() and add it again using add_role() with the new capabilities. 

Make sure to do it only if the capabilities differ from what you’re expecting (i.e. condition this) or you’ll degrade performance considerably! 
### Removing Roles 

Remove roles with remove_role() . 

```php
function wporg_simple_role_remove() {
	remove_role( 'simple_role' );
}

// Remove the simple_role.
add_action( 'init', 'wporg_simple_role_remove' );
```
After the first call to remove_role() , the Role and it’s Capabilities will be removed from the database! 

Sequential calls will do nothing. If you’re removing the default roles: 

- We advise against removing the Administrator and Super Admin roles! 

- Make sure to keep the code in your plugin/theme as future WordPress updates may add these roles again. 

- Run `update_option('default_role', YOUR_NEW_DEFAULT_ROLE) `since you’ll be deleting `subscriber `which is WP’s default role. 


## Capabilities 

Capabilities define what a role can and can not do: edit posts, publish posts, etc. 
Custom post types can require a certain set of Capabilities. 
### Adding Capabilities 

You may define new capabilities for a role. 

Use get_role() to get the role object, then use the `add_cap() `method of that object to add a new capability. 

```php
function wporg_simple_role_caps() {
	// Gets the simple_role role object.
	$role = get_role( 'simple_role' );

	// Add a new capability.
	$role->add_cap( 'edit_others_posts', true );
}

// Add simple_role capabilities, priority must be after the initial role definition.
add_action( 'init', 'wporg_simple_role_caps', 11 );
```
It’s possible to add custom capabilities to any role. 

Under the default WordPress admin, they would have no effect, but they can be used for custom admin screen and front-end areas. 
### Removing Capabilities 

You may remove capabilities from a role. 

The implementation is similar to Adding Capabilities with the difference being the use of `remove_cap() `method for the role object. 

## Using Roles and Capabilities 

### Get Role 

Get the role object including all of it’s capabilities with get_role() . 

```php
get_role( $role );
```

### User Can 

Check if a user have a specified role or capability with user_can() . 

```php
user_can( $user, $capability );
```
There is an undocumented, third argument, $args, that may include the object against which the test should be performed. 

E.g. Pass a post ID to test for the capability of that specific post. 
### Current User Can 

current_user_can() is a wrapper function for user_can() using the current user object as the `$user `parameter. 

Use this in scenarios where back-end and front-end areas should require a certain level of privileges to access and/or modify. 

```php
current_user_can( $capability );
```

### Example 

Here’s a practical example of adding an Edit link on the in a template file if the user has the proper capability: 

```php
if ( current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) {
	edit_post_link( esc_html__( 'Edit', 'wporg' ), '<p>', '</p>' );
}
```

## Multisite 

The current_user_can_for_blog() function is used to test if the current user has a certain role or capability on a specific blog. 

```php
current_user_can_for_blog( $blog_id, $capability );
```
